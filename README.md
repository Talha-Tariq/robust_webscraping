## Robust Web Scraping with Proxies using Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and Requests, 2020

This repository contains Python Notebooks that can help your web scraping endeavours while using proxies. These proxies are anonymous and use the HTTPS protocol, so you can be confident that your true IP address and any sensitive information being exchanged will be hidden.

### Scraping FREE proxies smoothly
These proxies are FREE proxies and will be scraped using the 'proxyscrape' library. Its documentation can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/proxyscrape/
List of websites where free proxies are scraped from: https://free-proxy-list.net/anonymous-proxy.html , https://free-proxy-list.net , http://www.proxy-daily.com , https://www.socks-proxy.net , https://www.sslproxies.org , https://free-proxy-list.net/uk-proxy.html , https://www.us-proxy.org

Follow the Notebook named 'scraping_proxies.ipynb' to best understand how this library can be used.
